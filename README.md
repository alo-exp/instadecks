## Overview

Instadecks is a [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) marketplace plugin that ships four user-invocable slash skills for end-to-end deck work: authoring, design review, content/argument review, and findings annotation. It productizes the v8 BluePrestige deck-building workflow (calibrated palette, typography, eight slide types, and an auto-refine convergence loop) into a reusable plugin under [Alo Labs](https://github.com/alo-exp).

The pipeline composes naturally — `/instadecks:create` produces a deck; `/instadecks:review` and `/instadecks:content-review` emit findings JSON in a locked schema; `/instadecks:annotate` overlays those findings on the deck as a PPTX + PDF.

## Install

From inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add alo-exp/instadecks
/plugin install instadecks
```

For local development:

```
git clone https://github.com/alo-exp/instadecks.git
cd instadecks
npm ci
```

After install, run [`/instadecks:doctor`](#instadecksdoctor-self-check) to self-check that all system prerequisites (LibreOffice, Poppler, Node ≥ 18, pinned `pptxgenjs@4.0.1`, IBM Plex Sans) are present. The SessionStart hook (`hooks/check-deps.sh`) handles the npm install and font-unpack steps automatically on first run; the doctor surfaces any host-installed binaries that still need attention.

## Quick Start

```
/instadecks:create — "Build me a pitch deck from this brief: ..."
/instadecks:review — "Review my deck for design defects: deck.pptx"
/instadecks:content-review — "Is my deck persuasive? deck.pptx"
/instadecks:annotate — "Overlay these findings on my deck: deck.pptx findings.json"
```

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/instadecks:create`           | Generate a polished deck from any input (markdown, PDF, transcript, brief, URL); auto-refined to convergence.                        |
| `/instadecks:review`           | Design critique using the DECK-VDA 4-pass methodology with finding-grammar output and AI-tell detection.                             |
| `/instadecks:content-review`   | Argument-structure and narrative critique (Pyramid Principle / MECE / standalone-readability), distinct from visual review.          |
| `/instadecks:annotate`         | Overlay design-review findings on a deck as PPTX + PDF, given a deck file and findings JSON in the locked schema.                    |
| `/instadecks:doctor`           | Self-check Instadecks system prerequisites (soffice, pdftoppm, node, pptxgenjs, IBM Plex Sans) and report green/red with install hints. |

## /instadecks:doctor Self-Check

The doctor skill probes every system prerequisite in one pass and reports a per-row OK / MISSING table with copy-pasteable install commands per OS. Run it after first install, after a host OS upgrade, or whenever any other skill fails with a missing-binary error.

Per-prerequisite install hints:

- **LibreOffice / `soffice`** — `brew install --cask libreoffice` (Mac) | `apt install libreoffice` (Linux) | `choco install libreoffice-fresh` (Windows)
- **Poppler / `pdftoppm`** — `brew install poppler` (Mac) | `apt install poppler-utils` (Linux) | `choco install poppler` (Windows)
- **Node ≥ 18** — `brew install node` (Mac) | `apt install nodejs` (Linux) | `choco install nodejs` (Windows)

The pinned `pptxgenjs@4.0.1` install and the bundled IBM Plex Sans font are handled automatically by the SessionStart hook; the doctor confirms both are reachable.

## Architecture

Instadecks is a Claude Code marketplace plugin shipping 5 namespaced slash skills under `skills/`. The `/instadecks:annotate` skill bundles `annotate.js` verbatim from v8 BluePrestige (SHA-pinned binary asset) and consumes findings JSON in the locked Instadecks schema (1.0 / 1.1). `/instadecks:review` and `/instadecks:content-review` produce findings in that schema; `/instadecks:create` composes a per-run `render-deck.cjs` from a curated pptxgenjs cookbook and wraps the output in an auto-refine convergence loop. `/instadecks:doctor` self-checks system prerequisites. Single repo, single npm tree, pinned `pptxgenjs@4.0.1`.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 18
- LibreOffice (`soffice` on `PATH`) — used for PPTX → PDF conversion
- Poppler (`pdftoppm` on `PATH`) — used for PDF → PNG rasterization

The SessionStart hook auto-installs npm dependencies (including pinned `pptxgenjs@4.0.1`) into the plugin data directory and unpacks IBM Plex Sans from the bundled archive. System binaries (`soffice`, `pdftoppm`) must be installed via the host package manager — the hook detects them and surfaces clear install hints if missing.
